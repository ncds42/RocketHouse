        p.aboutContent When I met Karim many years ago, he struck me as a smart and sensitive guy who had many things going for him. Karim is a writer, photographer, painter, and public speaker. He shares many topics including relationships, marriage, divorce, religion, and politics. After getting to know Karim, I realized he was a social guy with countless friends who loved his sincerity, passion, and devotion. They really adored him. I decided one day to ask Karim the question I had on my mind when I met him, “Why are you still single?” He smiled big and said, “Misty, that is the million-dollar question.” For a guy who lives by the paradigm of Love, that is an expensive question. Regardless of the why, Karim has lived in both the married and divorced worlds, and has used his experience to write a much-needed and highly entertaining book. Marriage Advice from a Divorced Guy, 50 Ways to Woo your Lover, With Notes from his Ex-Wife, is a book like no other. Sure, marriage advice is nothing new. There are countless books on the topic written by the brightest academic minds and the most experienced marriage therapists, but never by a Divorced Guy.As a family and marriage therapist for decades, I was deeply impacted when reading the following chapters: Engage Your Senses, Share some Secrets, Do the Right Thing, Lose the Argument to Win Big, and Give more than you Take. None of these thoughts are profound, but they are incredibly important as we deal with our husbands, wives, or lovers. Karim shares from the deepest recesses of his soul when he tells us to Listen with our Ears and our Hearts, Look in the Mirror, Dream Big Together, and Be Friends with our Lovers. You will feel the pain he endures when he says to Search for Love Despite the Difficulty. Then you will laugh out loud when you read the Notes from his Ex-Wife, they are hysterical! This is a book that will truly keep you engaged and entertained from cover to cover. I received a Doctorate in Counselor Education in 2007. I have been a Licensed Professional Counselor for 17 years, and a Certified Sex Therapist for 3 years. The Ask Dr. Misty column in About Town magazine is in its third year, and my local monthly segment, Where is the Love, on Fox 6 - Good Day Alabama has aired for seven years. When I’m not managing my private practice and seeing clients, I spend my time speaking, contributing on radio shows, and writing for various publications. With my vast  experience, this is the first time I encounter such a unique and fresh look at relationship advice. If you strive to protect your marriage from divorce, and improve all aspects of your love life, I strongly encourage you to pick up this book and get ready for some insightful reading.
